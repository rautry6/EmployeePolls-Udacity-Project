# Employee Polls Project

This app is an employee poll app that allows the user to login in to their account, view the polls they have answered, the polls they have not yet answered, create new polls, answer polls, view the results of the polls they answer, and see their position on the leaderboard.

The `_DATA.js` file represents a fake database with a list of pre-defined users and questions.

## TL;DR

To get started developing right away:

- install all project dependencies with `npm install`
- start the development server with `npm start`

## Important

Due to how the project is set up, data is not persisted between sessions. This means if you close and reopen the app or reload the page, the app will default back to the original state with the data from `_DATA.js` file.
